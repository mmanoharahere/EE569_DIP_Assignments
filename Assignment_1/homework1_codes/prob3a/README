SYSTEM CONFIGURATION IN WHICH THIS CODE RAN:

OS: Mac OS High Sierra 64-bit

Software: CLion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS TO DEBUG CODE:

1. Open Command prompt.

2. Run this command in the project folder:
    mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

3. You should see the program executable named - ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise in this build folder

4. ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise executable should be run with these arguments:
program_name =./ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise

<program_name> <input_image>.raw <output_image>.raw <ImgWidth> <ImgHeight> <BytesPerPixel> <noisefreeImage>.raw <filter1Output.raw> <filter2Output.raw> <originalHist.txt> <filter1Histogram.txt> <filter2Histogram.txt> <neighborhood>"

where;
program_name: 	the name of the .exe file generated
input_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as input for processing
output_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to which the processesed image is saved
ImgWidth: 	Width of the image
ImgHeight: 	Height of the image
BytesPerPixel: 	bytes per pixel (for RGB = 3 and for GRAY = 1)
noisefreeImage.raw: the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as noise free input for processing
filter1Output.raw: the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as output after filter 1 processing
filter2Output.raw: the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as output after filter 2 processing
originalHist.txt:   the name of the .txt file along with path to be taken as input to read the histogram
filter1Histogram.txt: the name of the .txt file along with path to be taken as input for read the histogram after filter 1
filter2Histogram.txt:   the name of the .txt file along with path to be taken as input for read the histogram after filter 2
neighborhood: int value 'N' of NxN neighborhood
