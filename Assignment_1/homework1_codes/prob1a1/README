SYSTEM CONFIGURATION IN WHICH THIS CODE RAN:

OS: Mac OS High Sierra 64-bit

Software: CLion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS TO DEBUG CODE:

1. Open Command prompt.

2. Run this command in the project folder:
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make


3.You should see the program executable named - ColorToGray_HW_1_1 in this build folder

4.ColorToGray_HW_1_1 executable should be run with these arguments:
program_name = ./ColorToGray_HW_1_1
<program_name> <input_image>.raw <output_image>.raw <ImgWidth> <ImgHeight> <BytesPerPixel><lightImg.raw> <averageImg.raw> <LuminosityImg.raw>

where;
program_name: 	the name of the .exe file generated
input_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as input for processing
output_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to which the processesed image is saved
ImgWidth: 	Width of the image
ImgHeight: 	Height of the image
BytesPerPixel: 	bytes per pixel (for RGB = 3 and for GRAY = 1)
lightImg.raw :  the name of the .raw file along with path to be outputted after lightness method processing
averageImg.raw: the name of the .raw file along with path to be outputted after average method processing
LuminosityImg.raw:  the name of the .raw file along with path to be outputted after luminosity method processing

Example that works for me:
./ColorToGray_HW_1_1 /Users/mansi/Documents/imageProcessing/images/HW_1/p2/Desk.raw 400 300 3 /Users/mansi/Documents/imageProcessing/images/HW_1/p2/DeskLum.raw /Users/mansi/Documents/imageProcessing/images/HW_1/p2/DeskAvg.raw /Users/mansi/Documents/imageProcessing/images/HW_1/p2/DeskLight.raw
