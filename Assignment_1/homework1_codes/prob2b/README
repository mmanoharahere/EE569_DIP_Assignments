3.You should see the program executable named - ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise in this build folder

4. . ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise executable should be run with these arguments:
program_name =./ImageProcessingHW_1CMD_Noise

<program_name> <input_image>.raw <output_image>.raw <ImgWidth> <ImgHeight> <BytesPerPixel> <reduced.raw> <quantized.raw> <int neighborhood>

where;
program_name: 	the name of the .exe file generated
input_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to be taken as input for processing
output_image: 	the name of the .raw file along with path to which the processesed image is saved
ImgWidth: 	Width of the image
ImgHeight: 	Height of the image
BytesPerPixel: 	bytes per pixel (for RGB = 3 and for GRAY = 1)
reduced.raw:    the name of the .raw file along with path to be outputted after Step 1
quantized.raw:  the name of the .raw file along with path to be outputted after Step 2
int neighborhood: int 'N' value of NxN neighborhood
